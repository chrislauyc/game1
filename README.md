Theme of the game:

shoots and ladders!!!

How the game works:

You have the GUI as a normal board game. As for rolling the dice, we can have a flashing screen of numbers and you will have to click to stop at the number you want. 

Work to be done:

--> GUI in pygame
--> underlying code

tree:

CAL.py -->GUI.py

CAL.py -->DLL.py

main.py -->GUI.py

main.py -->CAL.py
