# Chutes and Ladders game

How the game works:
First player to make it to the end wins!

You have the GUI as a normal board game. As for rolling the dice, we can have a flashing screen of numbers and you will have to click to stop at the number you want. 

Work to be done:
Implement moving back and forth in the CAL class
Make an object to be moved across the grid to a point at a (X,Y) coordinate cooresponding to a number inside a Node.
